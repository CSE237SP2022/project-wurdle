# project-wurdle

What user stories were completed this iteration?
  - We were able to take in the file of WashU wordle words that we came up with
  - Created the word for the game 
  - Generate the game board and print the board
  - Get the users first guess
  - Compare the first users guess with the random WASHU word

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  - Figure out a way to display if the letter is correct and when the letter is correct and in the right place
  - Also after this display to the user, use the scanner to get there next guess
  - Implement the 5 guess rule
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  - Nope, everything so far works correctly!
  
What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  - use the script ./script.sh

file with words
generate random word
print empty board
if whole word is correct - match
otherwise ends when no more guesses
