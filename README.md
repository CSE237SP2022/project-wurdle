## Iteration 1:
What user stories were completed this iteration?
  - We were able to take in the file of WashU wordle words that we came up with
  - Created the word for the game 
  - Generate the game board and print the board
  - Get the users first guess
  - Compare the first users guess with the random WASHU word

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  - Figure out a way to display if the letter is correct and when the letter is correct and in the right place
  - Also after this display to the user, use the scanner to get there next guess
  - Implement the 6 guess rule
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  - Nope, everything so far works correctly!
  
What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  - use the script ./script.sh

## Iteration 2:

What user stories were completed this iteration?
  - Worked on getting the second guess from the user
  - Give feedback in the form of words about which letters are correct and incorrect
  - Display the letters remaining after each guess

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  - Display in the board with x's and -'s the feedback for each word
  - implement five letter cap
  - Implement the 6 guess rule
  
Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  - although everything currently in the code works correctly, we were working on implementing a scanner for number of consecutive guesses, and had to move it to the next iteration to continue working on it
  
What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  - use the script ./script.sh
